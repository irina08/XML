<h3>The main differences between XSLT 1.0 and XSLT 2.0</h3>
<p>1) XSLT 2.0 defines 2 levels for the language: the XSLT 2.0 processor can be 
a basic XSLT processor, or it can be a Schema aware processor(it allows the type
system of XSLT to be infinitely extensible: validate input and output trees, 
validate temporary trees, use user-defined types in the XPath expressions and 
template match patterns). XSLT defines only 1 level: a basic XSLT processor.<br>
2) XSLT 1.0 had a very restricted type system. It only defined 5 data types: String, 
number, boolean, node-set, result tree. XSLT 2.0 provides a very extensive type system.<br>
3) XSLT 2.0 has style sheets that only have a template rule for the root node, 
and no other template rules like in XSLT 1.0.<br>
4) XSLT 2.0 has direct support for generating XHTML-compliant output documents.<br>
5) With XSLT 2.0 we can produce multiple output documents from a single run of 
the processor.<br>
6) XSLT 2.0 supports newest instruction called xsl:function, which allows user-defined 
functions, and allows use them in XPath expressions.<br>
7) XSLT 2.0 allows templates and functions accept and return typed value.<br>
8) With the introduction of 'xsl:for-each-group' instruction in XSLT 2.0, grouping 
of XML data is now much easier.<br>
9) XSLT 1.0 cannot validate its own output against an XML Schema.<br>
XSLT 2.0 include the ability to validate the output of XSLT transformation 
against an XML Schema, as a part of the XSLT transformation.<br>
10) XSLT 2.0 allows to create more than one result tree.<br>
11) Many XSLT 2.0 instructions can operate on regular expressions (matches, replace, tokenize).<br>
12) For various error conditions, error codes have been defined, and the XSLT 2.0 
processor is required to support all these error conditions and codes.</p>

<h3>The main differences between XPath 1.0 and XPath 2.0</h3> 	
<p>1) XPath 2.0 supports new data model  - XDM (XQuery/Xpath Data Model). 
It makes XPath 2.0 a strongly typed language.<br> 
2) XPath 1.0 supports only 4 data types: string, boolean, node-set, number.<br> 
XPath 2.0 supports new data types based on XML schema (XPath 2.0 supports 
all the simple primitive types built into XML schema). The XPath 2.0 data 
model also supports data types that we can derive from these data types in 
our own XML schema.<br>
3) XPath 2.0 has a lot of newest built-in functions that we can use, and many more operators. 
These functions and operators are far more type-aware than what we have seen in XPath 1.0. 
(more date-time functions, string functions).<br>
4) The return value of expressions in XPath 2.0 is a sequence (it is a comma-separated, ordered 
list of items, where an item is defined as either a node or an atomic value (it is a simple 
type or a custom type derived by restriction)). Sequence can have a duplicate value.
To remove duplicate items from sequence we can use distinct-values() built-in function.<br>
5) Instead of using function 'sum(value) div count(value)' for counting average 
we can use new functions in XPath 2.0 like avg(), min(), max().<br>
6) XPath 2.0 has more new built-in functions for formatting string 
like upper-case(), lower-case(), not only translate().<br>
7) XPath 2.0 has the ability to test for conditions within an XPath expression 
itself with "if-then-else". The test condition can be any expression that evaluates 
to a boolean value, not only an expression using nodes.<br>
8) For expression in XPath 2.0 let us handle sequences by looping, or iterating, 
over all items in a sequence.<br>
9) With XPath 2.0 we can write comments using next construction: (: comments go here :).<br>
10) In XPath 1.0, we could use the | operator to create the union (combination) of two sets. 
In XPath 2.0, we can create not only unions (using operator 'union'), 
but also intersections(all items two sequences have in common) using operator 'intersect', 
and differences (all items that two sequences have that are not in common) using 
operator 'except'.</p>
